-- | This module is defined internally to avoid using the 'these'
--   package, which brings in a lot of very heavy and unnecessary 
--   transitive dependencies. We export the type and constructors
--   here, in case a user should need it.
--   We provide a small API for working with the 'These' type here.
--   If one should need a fuller API, see https://hackage.haskell.org/package/these
--   Converting to/from the two types should be trivial, as the
--   data constructors are exported from both.
